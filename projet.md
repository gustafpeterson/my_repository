# ASPP project description
# Documentation of a Soil Depth Model
Modelling of soil depth based on data accessed from the Geological Survey of Sweden databases and topographic detailed elevation models of the Swedish Mapping Authority.

## Goal of this project
Proper documentation and apply GitHub project management to the SoilDepthModel code.
I am not an experienced programmer. However, I do use python in my work (at least on a weekly basis). The tasks I do are mostly automatizing of external ‘functions’, often connected to GIS (Geographic Information Systems) systems such as the ESRI products. The problem is that the most complex part of the calculations are performed in commercial software packages and consequently hard to optimize.
I have a script which produces a model over Swedens depth from the ground surface to the bedrock surface, a soil depth model. This code works, however, it is in a more or less completely undocumented state and of that reason really hard to debug.
Furthermore, there is a plan of more people getting involved in the development in this model. Due to the terrible documentation it has it is hard to get other people involved.
With this project I hope to document the code properly, make sure that me and others can work with it through GitHub.

## Outcome
  * The documentation is properly documented using Sphinx, it is alot of code so it took a considerable amount of time.
  * During the time spent going through the code a bunch of obsolete functions and files were found, these were removed.
